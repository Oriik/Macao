Macao is a poker game that my father developed in 1985-86 on his MO5 computer.
We decided to try to recreate it, using DCMOTO emulator (http://dcmoto.free.fr/).

All the code is contain in the "Macao.txt" file.

Convert the code in .k7 format using TXT2K7_MO5 from http://dskcenter.free.fr/TO7/. Just run GenerateMacao.bat to start the conversion. 
Then load and run the MACAO_MO5.k7 in DCMOTO like an usual k7.
